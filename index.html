    <p class="fs"> During construction of my pong game, I overcame many feats, such as color changes, movement, and the return function
        for the colors I simply added  ball color and player color variables and put in fill(ballcolor) and fill(playercolor) which would allow for the 
        ball and players color to change. For movement I used chatgpt to help me understand what was wrong and then changed how the players movement was run 
        allowing for both to move at the same time. Lastly for the return function I checked when the last power function was run and ran revert function which would
        wait 5 seconds and revert what was ran. 
    </p>
    <p class="fx">To make the project i used css, javascript, and html. Html did most of the layout while css would style the
      layout adding colors, spacing, and font sizes. lastly javascript gives my pong game functionality without it it would just be
      a few floating rectangles and a ball.
